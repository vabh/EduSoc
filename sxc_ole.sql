Modernism and Postmodernism, have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal philosophical or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences.', 'basicarch-U2-C1-P1.jpg', NULL, 'Introduction', 1),

Major examples of this can be found in greener roof designs, biodegradable materials,and more attention to a structure''s energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright, in the 1960s by Buckminster Fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as Ian McHarg and Sim Van der Ryn in the US and Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques.[12] The U.S. Green Building Council''s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this.[13] An example of an architecturally innovative green building is the Dynamic Tower which will be powered by wind turbines and solar panels.[14]', 'basicarch-U2-C1-P2.jpg', 'basicarch-U2-C1-P2.mp4', 'Environment and the architecture', 1),

The finished building as product is less important in conceptual architecture, than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations.

But the understanding of design as a construction of a concept was understood by many modernist architects as well.

Many are complex, but some give quick and accurate whole-earth estimates of impacts.
